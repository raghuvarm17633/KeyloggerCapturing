A keylogger, also known as a keystroke logger, is a type of malware that records every keystroke you make on your computer or mobile device. This information can then be used by hackers to steal your passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data.

There are two main types of keyloggers: hardware and software. Hardware keyloggers are physical devices that are installed on your computer or keyboard. Software keyloggers are programs that are installed on your computer.

Keyloggers can be installed in a variety of ways, including:

Downloading a malicious attachment from an email
Clicking on a malicious link
Visiting a compromised website
Opening a infected file
Once installed, a keylogger will start recording your keystrokes and sending the data to a hacker. The hacker can then use this data to steal your passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data.

There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from keyloggers:

Use a strong antivirus program
Keep your software up to date
Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on
Only download files from trusted sources
Use a virtual keyboard when entering sensitive data
